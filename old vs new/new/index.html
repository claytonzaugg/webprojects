					<h3>This one time, at Neumont...</h3>
					<p>To try and explain my time here at Neumont in such a short span of letters and paragraphs, is really not fair to those truly interested in my time here at Neumont.  However, because this is an example exercise, not really for those truly curious about my time, I'll simply parse the good parts and bad parts into a couple of paragraphs.  I'm not entirely sure it will be exciting or dramatic, but it will showcase my time here at Neumont as quick as possible.  You may continue on to the next paragraph now.</p>

					<h3>The Good Times</h3>
					<p>There are countless items I can discuss here, about how I've learned and grown as both a student and also as a fellow citizen in the world of life.  However it's a particular course that really pushed my boundaries and helped me to cement my true passion and solidify my destiny as a web developer.  Capstone.  This course was both brutal and richly rewarding at the same time.  I was finally able to tackle a large scale project on my own and learn so many new technologies in the process.  I thoroughly love working with Node.JS now as well as MongoDB.  I'm also a dedicated Linux user (Elementary OS is my distro of choice) and prepared for what the industry has for me.  In Capstone, I learned and I grew more than any other class here at Neumont.  I can only imagine it was because I was excited about the project and I was the one, from beginning to end, directing it.</p>

					<h3>The Good Times Squared</h3>
					<p>Many students think that once they get here, get the feel of things, they'll be okay going forward.  I was never one of these students and I never had this mentallity.  My entire time here at Neumont has been a challenge, with only one course being a complete and utter joy for me.  Meaning, I didn't struggle, I didn't get stuck on thought processes and logic, I simply worked and enjoyed.  This class was my Media Design Class, the one where you get to shoot and edit video.  It was such a joy for me, to finally just have fun and play with the tools I'm given, instead of stress about how coding this way or that way will product this or that or... Because of my passion for movies and the entertainment industry, I really took hold of this course and spent countless hours, literally, editing and fine tuning each assignment so they would shine, and I truly believe I was able to do just that.  I love all the productions I made and I was also given great compliments by my bears and professor.  This was my most enjoyable class.</p>
